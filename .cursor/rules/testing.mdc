# Testing Policy - DISABLED

## **CRITICAL: NO TESTING**

This project is in solo development mode with **NO TESTING whatsoever**.

### ❌ NEVER:
- Write unit tests
- Write widget tests
- Write integration tests
- Run `flutter test`
- Run `dart test`
- Add test dependencies
- Create test files
- Reference testing frameworks
- Suggest writing tests
- Mention TDD (Test-Driven Development)
- Use mocking frameworks

### ✅ ALWAYS:
- Implement features directly
- Rely on manual testing
- Focus on shipping features fast
- Test functionality through the running app
- Use `flutter run` to verify changes

## Development Workflow

**Instead of tests:**
1. Implement feature
2. Run the app (`flutter run`)
3. Manually verify functionality
4. Ship it

**No safety net needed** - move fast and ship features.

## Rule Updates

This rule overrides all previous testing guidelines. Any references to:
- TDD (Test-Driven Development)
- RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycle
- Test coverage requirements
- Writing tests first
- Test files or test directories

...are **null and void**.

## References

Previous testing guidelines are **DISABLED and should be IGNORED**.
