# Product Context

## Why This Project Exists

### The Problem (International Communicator Persona)
People with friends/family/colleagues speaking different languages face:
1. **Language barriers** slow down conversations
2. **Translation nuances** and context loss
3. **Copy-paste overhead** with translation tools
4. **Learning difficulty** for language practice
5. **Formality confusion** across cultures

### The Solution
A 7-day sprint to build a messaging app that combines WhatsApp-like reliability with AI-powered international communication features:
- **Real-time inline translation** 
- **Language detection & auto-translate**
- **Cultural context hints**
- **Formality level adjustment**
- **Slang/idiom explanations**
- **Advanced**: Context-aware smart replies OR intelligent data extraction

## How It Should Work

### Core User Flows

#### 1. Basic Messaging
1. User opens app → sees conversation list sorted by recent activity
2. Taps conversation → opens chat with real-time message sync
3. Types message → sends instantly with optimistic UI
4. Works offline → messages queue and sync when online

#### 2. International Communication
1. User receives message in Spanish
2. App auto-detects language, shows translation toggle
3. User taps to see English translation
4. User replies in English → recipient sees Spanish translation
5. Original + translations stored for context preservation

#### 3. AI Smart Replies
1. User receives message
2. App shows 3 context-aware reply suggestions in recipient's language
3. Suggestions consider: conversation history, tone, cultural norms
4. User taps suggestion → message sent (can edit first)

#### 4. Thread Management
1. Long conversation accumulates 50+ messages
2. User taps "Summarize" → AI extracts key topics and decisions
3. User taps "Action Items" → AI lists tasks with assignees
4. Smart search finds relevant messages using semantic understanding

### User Experience Goals

#### Speed & Responsiveness
- **Instant feedback**: Optimistic UI updates
- **Fast AI responses**: Reasonable latency for AI features
- **Smooth UI**: No janky animations

#### Reliability (MVP Requirements)
- **Works offline**: Local-first architecture with background sync
- **Never lose messages**: Queue with retry logic
- **Survives app lifecycle**: Background, foreground, force quit

#### Intelligence (5 Required + 1 Advanced)
- **Context-aware**: AI considers conversation history
- **Culturally sensitive**: Respects formality levels
- **Multilingual**: Support major languages

#### Simplicity
- **Auto-detect languages**: No manual configuration
- **Inline features**: AI integrated into natural workflow
- **WhatsApp-familiar**: Leverage existing mental models
