## Notes

### Test-Driven Development Approach
Following strict TDD for all new code:
1. **RED**: Write failing test first
2. **GREEN**: Implement minimum code to pass
3. **REFACTOR**: Clean up while keeping tests green

### Coverage Goals
- Domain layer: 100% (pure business logic)
- Data layer: 90%+ (I/O operations)
- Presentation layer: 80%+ (UI logic)
- Overall: 85%+ minimum

### Key Learnings
- Firestore Timestamp vs String serialization issues
- Need to include all required fields in models
- RecordAlreadyExistsException needs explicit mapping
- AppException subclasses should rethrow, not wrap
- Stream testing requires named parameter mocking

### Demo Video Planning (5-7 minutes)
Must show:
- [ ] Real-time messaging between two devices
- [ ] Group chat with 3+ participants
- [ ] Offline scenario
- [ ] App lifecycle handling
- [ ] All 5 required AI features
- [ ] Advanced AI capability
