# Project Progress

## ✅ Completed Milestones

### Sprint 1-3: Foundation, Testing, Riverpod 3.x Upgrade (COMPLETE)
See previous memory bank entries for details. Key achievements:
- Clean architecture with Riverpod 3.x
- 688 passing tests
- Authentication & basic messaging
- All dependencies resolved

### Sprint 4: Offline-First Architecture (COMPLETED!) 🎉

**MAJOR MILESTONE: Full Offline-First Implementation**

#### What We Built
```
✅ Local Persistence Layer
  - MessageLocalDataSource with drift
  - ConversationLocalDataSource with drift
  - Complete CRUD operations
  - Conflict resolution (hasConflict, resolveConflict, mergeMessages)
  - 48 passing tests for messages
  - 45 passing tests for conversations

✅ Sync & Queue Services
  - MessageSyncService (bidirectional sync)
  - MessageQueue (optimistic UI + retry logic)
  - Exponential backoff with jitter
  - Dead letter queue for failed messages
  - 17 passing tests for sync
  - 18 passing tests for queue

✅ Repository Updates
  - MessageRepositoryImpl: offline-first with local+remote
  - ConversationRepositoryImpl: offline-first with local+remote
  - Bidirectional sync (Firestore ↔ Local DB ↔ UI)
  - Upsert mode in batch operations (prevents rollbacks)

✅ Real-Time Features
  - Typing indicators (22 service tests, 11 widget tests)
  - Read receipts (visual checkmarks)
  - Online/offline presence indicators (22 service tests)
    - Green/grey dots on avatars
    - "Online" / "Last seen X ago" in chat header
    - Automatic lifecycle management

✅ Provider Integration
  - Database providers for drift
  - Sync service providers (keepAlive)
  - Queue providers (keepAlive)
  - Presence providers with auto-management
  - All initialized in App widget
```

#### Architecture Patterns Established
- **Offline-First Flow**:
  1. User action → Save to Local DB (immediate)
  2. UI Update (instant feedback)
  3. Background sync to Firestore
  4. Confirm sync status in local DB
- **Bidirectional Sync**:
  - Outgoing: Local → Firestore (background)
  - Incoming: Firestore → Local → UI (real-time)
- **Conflict Resolution**: server-wins, client-wins, merge strategies
- **Optimistic UI**: Instant feedback, background processing, retry with exponential backoff

#### Key Fixes Applied
1. Message ordering: Changed to ascending (oldest first) for standard chat behavior
2. Upsert mode: `InsertMode.insertOrReplace` in batch operations prevents ROLLBACK errors
3. Presence integration: Automatic online/offline tracking tied to auth state

### Sprint 5: Real-Time Features & Read Receipts (COMPLETED!) 🎉

**Tasks Completed**:
- Task 41: Typing indicators ✅
- Task 122: Online/offline status indicators ✅
- Task 123: Read receipts with delivery status ✅

**Implementation**:
- `TypingIndicatorService` with debouncing (3s timeout)
- `PresenceService` with heartbeat (30s interval)
- `AutoDeliveryMarker` for automatic delivered status
- Automatic lifecycle via providers
- UI components: `TypingIndicator` widget, presence dots on avatars, status in chat header, delivery checkmarks in message bubbles

### Sprint 6: Push Notifications (COMPLETED!) 🎉

**Tasks Completed**:
- Task 42: Push notifications ✅

**Implementation**:
1. **FCM Token Management**:
   - Automatic token retrieval with retry logic (iOS APNs)
   - Token refresh listener for updates
   - Firestore sync (user.fcmTokens array)
   - Token removal on logout

2. **Android Configuration**:
   - Notification channels with high importance ("messages" channel)
   - POST_NOTIFICATIONS permission (Android 13+)
   - Core library desugaring for Android 8+ compatibility
   - flutter_local_notifications integration

3. **iOS Configuration**:
   - Background modes (remote-notification)
   - Push notification capability
   - Runner.entitlements file
   - Complete setup documentation

4. **Notification Handling**:
   - Foreground: WhatsApp-style banner with sound/vibration
   - Background: System notification with delivered status marking
   - Tap: Navigation to chat with conversation context

5. **Cloud Functions**:
   - Python Cloud Functions for sending notifications
   - Separate triggers for direct and group messages
   - Platform-specific config (Android/APNs)
   - Firestore document ID in payload for status updates

**Critical Bug Fixes**:
- Fixed logout crash by moving FCM init to App widget with auth state control
- Fixed Android notification channels for proper display
- Added Firebase initialization in background handler (separate isolate)
- Corrected document ID passing (Firestore ID vs FCM message ID)
- Removed custom icon specification to use system default

**Files Created**:
- lib/features/messaging/data/services/fcm_service.dart (414 lines)
- functions/main.py (161 lines, Python Cloud Functions)
- docs/PUSH_NOTIFICATIONS_SETUP.md (comprehensive setup guide)

## 🎓 Key Learnings This Sprint
1. **Offline-First is Complex**: Requires careful thought about sync, conflicts, and error handling
2. **Upsert is Essential**: Batch operations need `InsertMode.insertOrReplace` to handle duplicates
3. **Bidirectional Sync**: Watching Firestore AND saving to local creates seamless real-time experience
4. **Presence Lifecycle**: Tying presence to auth state provides automatic, reliable online/offline tracking
5. **Provider Architecture**: `keepAlive` providers + initialization in App widget ensures services start on launch
6. **Simple is Better**: AutoDeliveryMarker service (watching conversations globally) is cleaner than per-chat manual marking
7. **Taskmaster Sync**: Critical to add tasks for features as they're implemented, not retroactively
8. **FCM Background Isolate**: Background handlers run in separate isolate, need explicit Firebase init
9. **Android Notification Channels**: Required for Android 8+ with proper configuration for display
10. **Provider Lifecycle Management**: Services dependent on auth must be initialized conditionally to prevent crashes
11. **Firestore Document IDs**: Always pass actual document IDs in payloads, not platform-specific message IDs
12. **Core Library Desugaring**: Essential for modern Java APIs on older Android devices
