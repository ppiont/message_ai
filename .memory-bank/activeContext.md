# Active Context

## 🎯 Current Focus: MVP Features - 80% Complete! 🎉

**Session Goal**: Just completed online/offline presence indicators. Ready for next MVP feature.

**Status**: 8/10 MVP features complete!

## 📍 Where We Are

### Just Completed (This Session)
1. ✅ Fixed bidirectional message sync (Firestore ↔ Local ↔ UI)
2. ✅ Fixed message ordering (ascending, oldest first)
3. ✅ Fixed ROLLBACK errors with upsert mode in batch inserts
4. ✅ Implemented online/offline presence indicators (Task 46)
   - Presence providers with automatic management
   - Green/grey dots on conversation list avatars
   - "Online" / "Last seen X ago" in chat header
   - Integrated with auth flow (auto online/offline on login/logout)
5. ✅ Updated memory bank and Taskmaster status

### Current Implementation Status

**Offline-First Architecture**: FULLY WORKING ✅
- Messages save locally immediately
- Background sync to Firestore
- Incoming messages: Firestore → Local DB → UI
- Bidirectional sync with upsert mode (no more rollbacks!)
- Works offline, syncs when online

**Messaging Features**: COMPLETE ✅
- ✅ One-on-one chat
- ✅ Real-time delivery
- ✅ Message persistence (drift + Firestore)
- ✅ Optimistic UI
- ✅ Timestamps
- ✅ Typing indicators
- ✅ Read receipts (checkmarks)
- ✅ Online/offline status

**What's Left for MVP**: 2 features remaining
1. **Push notifications** (Task 42) - Estimated 2-3 hours
2. **Group chat** (Tasks 49-58) - Estimated 4-6 hours

## 📊 Progress Update

**MVP Completion: 80%** (8/10 features)

### Completed This Sprint
- Sprint 4: Offline-first architecture (Tasks 28-44)
- Online/offline indicators (Task 46)

### Ready to Start
- **Task 42: Push notifications** (Next quick win!)
  - FCM setup
  - Notification handling
  - Background notifications
- **OR Tasks 49-58: Group chat** (Bigger feature)

## 🎯 Next Steps

**Immediate**: Choose next feature
1. Push notifications (quick, 2-3 hours)
2. Group chat (comprehensive, 4-6 hours)

**For Group Chat** (when ready):
- Will need to:
  - Extend conversation model for group metadata
  - Update UI for group member management
  - Add group-specific features (admin roles, member list, etc.)

## 💡 Technical Notes

### Presence Implementation
- `PresenceService` with heartbeat (30s interval)
- Automatic lifecycle via `presenceController` provider
- Firestore `presence` collection
- Real-time updates via streams
- Smart time formatting for "last seen"

### Current Architecture
```
UI Layer (Presentation)
  ↓
Domain Layer (Use Cases + Entities)
  ↓
Data Layer (Repositories + Models)
  ↓
Local DB (Drift/SQLite) ← Bidirectional → Remote DB (Firestore)
```

### Key Services Running
- MessageSyncService (bidirectional sync)
- MessageQueue (optimistic UI + retry)
- TypingIndicatorService (real-time typing)
- PresenceService (online/offline + heartbeat)

## 📝 Recent Learnings

1. **Upsert Mode**: Using `InsertMode.insertOrReplace` in batch operations prevents ROLLBACK errors when syncing duplicate data
2. **Presence Lifecycle**: Automatic presence management tied to auth state provides seamless online/offline tracking
3. **Stream Mapping**: Converting domain objects (e.g., `UserPresence`) to simple maps for UI consumption simplifies state management
