## 🎯 Current Focus: MVP Features - 80% Complete! 🎉

**Session Goal**: Synced Taskmaster and Memory Bank. Ready to complete final 2 MVP features!

**Status**: 8/10 MVP features complete!

## 📍 Where We Are

### Just Completed (This Session)
1. ✅ Fixed delivered status for read receipts
   - Implemented AutoDeliveryMarker service
   - Cleaned up previous broken MessageDeliveryTracker
   - Visual checkmarks now correctly show: sent (1 grey), delivered (2 grey), read (2 blue)
2. ✅ Synced Taskmaster with actual implementation
   - Added Task 122: Online/offline presence indicators (marked done)
   - Added Task 123: Read receipts with delivery status (marked done)
   - Verified all completed features are tracked
3. ✅ Updated memory bank to reflect current state

### Current Implementation Status

**Offline-First Architecture**: FULLY WORKING ✅
- Messages save locally immediately
- Background sync to Firestore
- Incoming messages: Firestore → Local DB → UI
- Bidirectional sync with upsert mode (no more rollbacks!)
- Works offline, syncs when online

**Messaging Features**: COMPLETE ✅
- ✅ One-on-one chat
- ✅ Real-time delivery
- ✅ Message persistence (drift + Firestore)
- ✅ Optimistic UI
- ✅ Timestamps
- ✅ Typing indicators
- ✅ Read receipts (checkmarks)
- ✅ Online/offline status

**What's Left for MVP**: 2 features remaining
1. **Push notifications** (Task 42) - Foreground minimum, estimated 2-3 hours
2. **Group chat (3+ users)** (Tasks 49-58) - Group creation, member management, estimated 4-6 hours

## 📊 Progress Update

**MVP Completion: 80%** (8/10 features)

### Completed This Sprint
- Sprint 4: Offline-first architecture (Tasks 28-44)
- Online/offline indicators (Task 46)

### Ready to Start
- **Task 42: Push notifications** (Next quick win!)
  - FCM setup
  - Notification handling
  - Background notifications
- **OR Tasks 49-58: Group chat** (Bigger feature)

## 🎯 Next Steps

**Immediate**: Complete final 2 MVP features
1. **Option A - Push Notifications** (Task 42)
   - Quick win: 2-3 hours
   - FCM setup for foreground notifications minimum
   - Can expand to background later

2. **Option B - Group Chat** (Tasks 49-58)
   - Comprehensive: 4-6 hours
   - Group creation, member management, admin roles
   - Extends existing conversation model
   - Group-specific UI components

**Recommendation**: Start with Push Notifications as a quick win, then tackle Group Chat to complete MVP.

## 💡 Technical Notes

### Presence Implementation
- `PresenceService` with heartbeat (30s interval)
- Automatic lifecycle via `presenceController` provider
- Firestore `presence` collection
- Real-time updates via streams
- Smart time formatting for "last seen"

### Current Architecture
```
UI Layer (Presentation)
  ↓
Domain Layer (Use Cases + Entities)
  ↓
Data Layer (Repositories + Models)
  ↓
Local DB (Drift/SQLite) ← Bidirectional → Remote DB (Firestore)
```

### Key Services Running
- MessageSyncService (bidirectional sync)
- MessageQueue (optimistic UI + retry)
- TypingIndicatorService (real-time typing)
- PresenceService (online/offline + heartbeat)
- AutoDeliveryMarker (automatic delivered status for incoming messages)

## 📝 Recent Learnings

1. **Upsert Mode**: Using `InsertMode.insertOrReplace` in batch operations prevents ROLLBACK errors when syncing duplicate data
2. **Presence Lifecycle**: Automatic presence management tied to auth state provides seamless online/offline tracking
3. **Stream Mapping**: Converting domain objects (e.g., `UserPresence`) to simple maps for UI consumption simplifies state management
