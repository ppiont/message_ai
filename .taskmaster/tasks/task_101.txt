# Task ID: 101
# Title: Implement OpenAI API caching
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 59
# Priority: high
# Description: Add caching for OpenAI API calls to reduce costs
# Details:
Implement caching strategy for different AI features as described in the PRD. Use Firestore for long-lived caches (summaries, decisions). Implement Redis or in-memory cache for short-lived data (smart replies). Add cache invalidation based on conversation updates.

# Test Strategy:
Write unit tests for caching logic. Test cache hit rates. Verify cache invalidation works correctly. Test with different cache durations.
