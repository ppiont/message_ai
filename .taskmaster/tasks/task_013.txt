# Title: Set up network connectivity monitoring
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 11
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement network connectivity monitoring to support offline-first functionality
# Details:
Add connectivity_plus dependency to pubspec.yaml. Create network_info.dart in the core/network directory. Implement a service to monitor network connectivity changes. Create a Riverpod provider for network status. Implement callbacks for network state changes to trigger sync operations.

# Test Strategy:
Write unit tests with mocked connectivity service. Test behavior when network status changes. Verify that appropriate actions are triggered on connectivity changes.
