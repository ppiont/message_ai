# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the Data Access Object for messages to handle local database operations
# Details:
Create message_dao.dart in core/database/daos directory. Implement methods for inserting, updating, deleting, and querying messages. Add methods for batch operations. Implement methods for querying messages by conversation ID with pagination. Create methods for handling unsynced messages and tracking sync status. Implement reactive streams for real-time UI updates.

# Test Strategy:
Write unit tests for all DAO methods. Test reactive streams with mock data. Verify pagination works correctly. Test edge cases like empty results and error handling.
