# Task ID: 102
# Title: Implement batch API for OpenAI
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 59
# Priority: medium
# Description: Use batch API calls for non-real-time AI features
# Details:
Implement batching for non-real-time AI features as described in the PRD. Combine multiple requests into single API calls where possible. Add queue for collecting requests. Implement timeout-based flushing for the queue. Balance between latency and efficiency.

# Test Strategy:
Write unit tests for batching logic. Test with different batch sizes. Verify timeout-based flushing works correctly. Test efficiency improvement.
