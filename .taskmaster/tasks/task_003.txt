# Task ID: 3
# Title: Set up Flutter flavors
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Configure Flutter flavors for development, staging, and production environments
# Details:
Create flavor-specific entry points (main_dev.dart, main_staging.dart, main_prod.dart). Configure Android build.gradle and iOS project settings to support multiple flavors. Set up flavor-specific app IDs, app names, and icons. Create environment-specific configuration files to store environment variables.

# Test Strategy:
Verify that the app can be built and run with each flavor using the commands specified in the PRD. Ensure that the correct Firebase project is used for each flavor.
