# Task ID: 9
# Title: Implement conversation DAO
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the Data Access Object for conversations to handle local database operations
# Details:
Create conversation_dao.dart in core/database/daos directory. Implement methods for inserting, updating, deleting, and querying conversations. Add methods for updating last message and unread counts. Implement methods for querying conversations by participant ID with sorting by lastUpdatedAt. Create reactive streams for real-time UI updates.

# Test Strategy:
Write unit tests for all DAO methods. Test reactive streams with mock data. Verify sorting works correctly. Test edge cases like empty results and error handling.
