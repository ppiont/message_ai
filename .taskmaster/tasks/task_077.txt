# Task ID: 77
# Title: Implement language detection with ML Kit
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Integrate Google ML Kit for on-device language detection
# Details:
Add google_mlkit_language_id dependency to pubspec.yaml. Create language_detector.dart in features/translation/data/services directory. Implement the detectLanguage method as described in the PRD. Configure confidence threshold for reliable detection. Add caching for improved performance.

# Test Strategy:
Write unit tests with mocked ML Kit. Test detection with different languages. Verify confidence threshold works correctly. Test caching functionality.
