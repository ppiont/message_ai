Added Firebase dependencies to pubspec.yaml:\n   - firebase_core, firebase_auth, cloud_firestore, firebase_storage\n   - firebase_messaging, firebase_crashlytics, cloud_functions\n   - Testing: fake_cloud_firestore, firebase_auth_mocks\n\n2. Android configuration updated:\n   - Added Google Services plugin to settings.gradle.kts\n   - Applied plugin in app/build.gradle.kts\n   - Changed package name to com.gauntlet.message_ai\n   - Updated app label to \"MessageAI\"\n\n3. Created firebase/ directory structure (dev/staging/prod)\n4. Created comprehensive setup guide: docs/FIREBASE_SETUP.md\n5. Created status tracker: firebase/SETUP_STATUS.md\n\nPending user actions:\n- Create Firebase projects in console (messageai-dev, messageai-staging, messageai-prod)\n- Enable required services in each project\n- Register Android and iOS apps with proper package names\n- Download configuration files and place in appropriate locations\n\nNext steps after console setup:\n- Update main.dart with Firebase initialization\n- Complete iOS configuration\n- Test Firebase connection\n</info added on 2025-10-20T21:14:51.819Z>\n<info added on 2025-10-20T21:16:09.206Z>\nEnvironment configuration has been updated to use only TWO environments (dev and prod) instead of three:\n\n1. Removed firebase/staging/ directory\n2. Updated documentation:\n   - docs/FIREBASE_SETUP.md now reflects dev and prod environments only\n   - docs/ARCHITECTURE.md updated with two-environment approach\n   - firebase/SETUP_STATUS.md updated to track only dev and prod setup\n\n3. Pending user actions revised:\n   - Create Firebase projects in console (messageai-dev and messageai-prod only)\n   - Enable required services in both projects\n   - Register Android and iOS apps with proper package names for both environments\n\n4.
