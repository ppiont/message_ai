Added Firebase dependencies to pubspec.yaml:\n   - firebase_core, firebase_auth, cloud_firestore, firebase_storage\n   - firebase_messaging, firebase_crashlytics, cloud_functions\n   - Testing: fake_cloud_firestore, firebase_auth_mocks\n\n2. Android configuration updated:\n   - Added Google Services plugin to settings.gradle.kts\n   - Applied plugin in app/build.gradle.kts\n   - Changed package name to com.gauntlet.message_ai\n   - Updated app label to \"MessageAI\"\n\n3. Created firebase/ directory structure (dev/staging/prod)\n4. Created comprehensive setup guide: docs/FIREBASE_SETUP.md\n5. Created status tracker: firebase/SETUP_STATUS.md\n\nPending user actions:\n- Create Firebase projects in console (messageai-dev, messageai-staging, messageai-prod)\n- Enable required services in each project\n- Register Android and iOS apps with proper package names\n- Download configuration files and place in appropriate locations\n\nNext steps after console setup:\n- Update main.dart with Firebase initialization\n- Complete iOS configuration\n- Test Firebase connection\n</info added on 2025-10-20T21:14:51.819Z>\n<info added on 2025-10-20T21:16:09.206Z>\nEnvironment configuration has been updated to use only TWO environments (dev and prod) instead of three:\n\n1. Removed firebase/staging/ directory\n2. Updated documentation:\n   - docs/FIREBASE_SETUP.md now reflects dev and prod environments only\n   - docs/ARCHITECTURE.md updated with two-environment approach\n   - firebase/SETUP_STATUS.md updated to track only dev and prod setup\n\n3. Pending user actions revised:\n   - Create Firebase projects in console (messageai-dev and messageai-prod only)\n   - Enable required services in both projects\n   - Register Android and iOS apps with proper package names for both environments\n\n4.

Implement proper error handling and retry logic. Ensure PII detection and sanitization before sending text to AI services. Generate three reply suggestions with different intents: positive (agree/accept), negative (decline/disagree), and neutral (defer/question).",
        "testStrategy": "Write unit tests for the SmartReplyService to verify style analysis and reply generation. Test semantic search by verifying relevant context is retrieved. Test caching behavior by generating replies for similar messages. Test error handling by simulating API failures. Test style learning by verifying detected style matches expected patterns. Test all three intent types with various inputs. Test PII detection and sanitization. Verify reply quality with different languages and conversation contexts.",

        "details": "Develop a centralized ErrorHandler class for AI services that categorizes errors (network, API limit, authentication, server, client) and provides appropriate responses. Implement an exponential backoff retry strategy for transient errors (network issues, rate limits) with configurable max retries (default: 3) and initial/max delay (100ms/5s). Create user-friendly error messages for different error types. Implement graceful degradation when AI services are unavailable (fall back to simpler functionality). Add comprehensive logging for all errors with appropriate detail level. Create a mechanism to report critical errors to a monitoring service. Implement circuit breaker pattern to prevent cascading failures when a service is consistently failing. Add analytics to track error rates and types for ongoing improvement.",

Test with various error types to ensure proper handling. Verify user-facing error messages are clear and helpful.",
