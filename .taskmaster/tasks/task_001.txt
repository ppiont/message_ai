# Task ID: 1
# Title: Set up Flutter project structure
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Initialize the Flutter project with the clean architecture structure as defined in the PRD
# Details:
Create the initial Flutter project using 'flutter create' command. Set up the folder structure following the clean architecture pattern with features-first organization. Create core directories (core/, features/, config/, l10n/) and set up the main.dart and app.dart files. Initialize Git repository and add .gitignore file.

# Test Strategy:
Verify that the project structure matches the PRD specification. Ensure the project builds without errors using 'flutter build' command.
