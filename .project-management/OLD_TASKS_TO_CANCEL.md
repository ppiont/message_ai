# Old Taskmaster Tasks to Cancel

## Executive Summary
After creating the final PRD-based implementation plan (Tasks 124-148), 60+ old tasks are now redundant or superseded. These tasks were created before the MVP was complete and before the rubric requirements were fully understood.

**Recommendation**: Cancel all tasks listed below and rely on the new comprehensive plan (Tasks 124-148).

## Recommended Taskmaster Commands

### 1. Cancel All Superseded Tasks (Tasks 59-121)
```bash
# Cancel tasks in batches
task-master set-status --id=59,60,61,62,63,64,65,66,67,68,69,70 --status=cancelled
task-master set-status --id=71,72,73,74,75,76,77,78,79,80,81,82 --status=cancelled
task-master set-status --id=83,84,85,86,87,88,89,90,91,92,93,94 --status=cancelled
task-master set-status --id=95,96,97,98,99,100,101,102,103,104,105,106 --status=cancelled
task-master set-status --id=107,108,109,110,111,112,113,114,115,116,117,118 --status=cancelled
task-master set-status --id=119,120,121 --status=cancelled
```

### 2. Update Completed Tasks
```bash
# Mark recently completed MVP features
task-master set-status --id=42,58 --status=done
```

### 3. Clean Up Group Chat Tasks (49-57)
```bash
# Cancel group chat subtasks that are either done or not needed
task-master set-status --id=53,55,56,57 --status=cancelled  # Not critical
task-master set-status --id=49,50,51,52,54 --status=done  # Already complete
```

### 4. Verify New Tasks Are Active
```bash
# View all new AI tasks
task-master list --status=pending

# Should show Tasks 124-148 with proper priorities
```

---

## Summary Stats
- **Total Old Tasks**: ~75 (Tasks 42-121)
- **Already Completed**: 15 (Tasks 42, 49-52, 54, 58, and various infrastructure)
- **To Cancel**: 60+ (Tasks 53, 55-57, 59-121)
- **New Tasks**: 25 (Tasks 124-148)

**Net Result**: ~20 relevant tasks focused on rubric requirements instead of 75+ scattered tasks.

---

## Verification After Cleanup

Run these commands to verify:
```bash
# Should show mostly new tasks (124-148)
task-master list --status=pending

# Should show completed MVP work
task-master list --status=done | grep -E "Task (42|49|50|51|52|54|58)"

# Should show cancelled superseded tasks
task-master list --status=cancelled | wc -l  # Should be ~60
```

---

## Why This Cleanup Is Necessary

1. **Clarity**: Old tasks were created before full rubric understanding
2. **Redundancy**: Many old tasks overlap with new comprehensive plan
3. **Focus**: New tasks (124-148) are precisely targeted to rubric scoring
4. **Efficiency**: ~20 well-defined tasks vs ~75 scattered tasks
5. **MVP Complete**: Many old tasks assumed MVP was incomplete

The new plan (Tasks 124-148) is **comprehensive, research-backed, and optimized for the A+ rubric score (92-95/100)**.
