You are a senior Flutter/Dart performance engineer conducting a comprehensive forensic analysis of a mobile application codebase. Your goal is to identify all performance bottlenecks, anti-patterns, and potential issues that could degrade app performance, increase memory usage, or cause crashes.

## ANALYSIS SCOPE

Perform a deep, systematic review of the entire codebase focusing on:

### 1. MEMORY LEAKS & MANAGEMENT
- Identify unclosed streams, controllers, and subscriptions (StreamController, AnimationController, TextEditingController, etc.)
- Check for missing dispose() calls in StatefulWidgets
- Look for listeners added but never removed
- Find circular references that prevent garbage collection
- Detect retained references to large objects (images, lists, caches)
- Examine global variables and singletons holding unnecessary data
- Review BuildContext usage in async operations (after widget disposal)

### 2. RENDERING PERFORMANCE
- Identify unnecessary widget rebuilds (missing const constructors, improper setState usage)
- Find missing RepaintBoundary widgets for expensive renders
- Detect unbounded ListView/GridView without proper builders
- Look for complex layouts that should use CustomPaint or Canvas
- Find widgets rebuilding entire trees when only children need updates
- Check for missing keys in lists causing unnecessary rebuilds
- Identify expensive operations in build() methods

### 3. STATE MANAGEMENT ISSUES
- Detect setState() called on disposed widgets
- Find overly broad setState() calls rebuilding too much UI
- Look for state management anti-patterns (excessive lifting, prop drilling)
- Identify redundant state updates causing cascade rebuilds
- Check for synchronous operations blocking the UI thread in state updates

### 4. ASYNC OPERATIONS & CONCURRENCY
- Find unawaited futures and missing error handling
- Identify infinite loops in async operations
- Detect race conditions in asynchronous code
- Look for synchronous I/O operations on the main thread
- Find computationally expensive operations not using Isolates
- Check for missing Future.timeout on network calls
- Identify chained async operations that could be parallelized

### 5. LIST & COLLECTION PERFORMANCE
- Find inefficient list operations (repeated .where(), .map() chains)
- Detect unnecessary list copying or conversions
- Look for O(nÂ²) or worse algorithmic complexity
- Identify missing pagination or lazy loading
- Find unoptimized search operations (linear when indexed could work)
- Check for large collections kept in memory unnecessarily

### 6. IMAGE & MEDIA HANDLING
- Identify unoptimized image loading (full resolution when thumbnails suffice)
- Find missing image caching strategies
- Detect memory-heavy image operations
- Look for missing precacheImage() for critical assets
- Check for animated images without proper disposal
- Find video/audio players without proper lifecycle management

### 7. DATABASE & STORAGE
- Identify inefficient database queries (missing indexes, N+1 queries)
- Find synchronous database operations on UI thread
- Detect excessive disk I/O operations
- Look for missing batch operations where applicable
- Check for unbounded query results

### 8. NETWORK OPERATIONS
- Find missing request cancellation mechanisms
- Identify redundant API calls for same data
- Detect missing caching strategies
- Look for large payloads without streaming or pagination
- Find missing timeout configurations
- Check for improper connection pooling

### 9. NAVIGATION & ROUTING
- Identify memory leaks in route stacks
- Find routes not properly disposed
- Detect unnecessary route rebuilds
- Look for deep navigation stacks causing memory pressure

### 10. THIRD-PARTY PACKAGES
- Identify outdated or poorly performing dependencies
- Find packages with known performance issues
- Detect duplicate functionality from multiple packages
- Look for heavy packages when lighter alternatives exist

### 11. BUILD & INITIALIZATION
- Find expensive operations in constructors or initState()
- Identify synchronous initialization blocking app startup
- Detect unnecessary work during app launch
- Look for missing lazy initialization patterns

### 12. COMMON ANTI-PATTERNS
- GlobalKey misuse
- Excessive use of Opacity widget (use AnimatedOpacity)
- Missing const constructors for immutable widgets
- Overuse of saveLayer operations
- Inappropriate use of Transform vs Container
- Unnecessary use of ClipRRect, ClipPath
- MediaQuery.of(context) called too frequently
- Missing SizedBox.shrink() for conditional empty widgets

## INVESTIGATION METHODOLOGY

1. **Start with the entry point** (main.dart) and trace critical user flows
2. **Profile hot paths** - focus on screens/features users access most
3. **Examine state-heavy widgets** - complex StatefulWidgets are common culprits
4. **Review service/repository layers** - often where business logic issues hide
5. **Check utility functions** - commonly called helpers can have outsized impact
6. **Analyze third-party integration points** - bridges between Flutter and native code

## DELIVERABLE FORMAT

Provide your findings as:

### CRITICAL ISSUES (Fix Immediately)
- Issue description
- Location (file path, line numbers)
- Performance impact assessment (High/Medium/Low)
- Specific recommendation with code example
- Estimated improvement

### MODERATE ISSUES (Should Fix Soon)
[Same format as above]

### OPTIMIZATION OPPORTUNITIES (Nice to Have)
[Same format as above]

### SUMMARY METRICS
- Total issues found by severity
- Most critical files/modules
- Estimated overall performance gain if issues resolved
- Priority order for fixes

## ANALYSIS RULES

- Provide specific file paths and line numbers for every issue
- Include code snippets showing the problem and the solution
- Prioritize issues by actual performance impact, not just code style
- Consider real-world usage patterns (what users actually do)
- Flag potential crash risks separately from performance issues
- Note if issues only affect debug mode vs release builds
- Consider platform-specific issues (iOS vs Android)

Begin your analysis now. Be thorough, specific, and actionable.
