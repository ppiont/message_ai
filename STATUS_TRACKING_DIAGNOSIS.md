# Message Status Tracking System - Diagnostic Guide

## âœ… FIXED: Sender Now Sees Delivery Status

**Issue:** Senders could never see when their messages were delivered/read because they were only querying their local database.

**Fix Applied:** When displaying messages sent by the current user, the system now:
1. Queries local MessageStatus table (for any local status)
2. **Also queries Firestore subcollections** to get recipients' delivery/read status
3. Merges both sources (Firestore takes precedence)
4. Displays the aggregate status in the UI

## Current Architecture (Post-Refactoring)

### 1. Local Status Tracking (PRIMARY SOURCE OF TRUTH for UI)
- **Table:** `MessageStatus` in Drift database
- **Columns:** `messageId`, `userId`, `status` ('sent', 'delivered', 'read'), `timestamp`
- **Purpose:** Offline-first status tracking, fast queries for UI

### 2. Remote Status Tracking (Firestore Subcollections)
- **Structure:** `messages/{messageId}/status/{userId}`
- **Fields:** `status`, `timestamp`, `userId`
- **Purpose:** Sync status across devices, backup

### 3. Legacy Fields (DEPRECATED - DO NOT USE)
- **Old structure:** `deliveredTo` and `readBy` maps in message document
- **Status:** These fields may still exist on old messages but are NO LONGER written by new code
- **Migration:** Not required - old fields are ignored by MessageModel.fromJson()

## How Status Updates Work

### When User Opens a Conversation (Delivery)

1. **chat_page.dart** line 72:
   ```dart
   ref.read(markMessagesDeliveredProvider(widget.conversationId, currentUser.uid));
   ```

2. **markMessagesDelivered()** provider (messaging_providers.dart:359-385):
   - Writes to LOCAL MessageStatus table via `messageStatusDao.markAllAsDelivered()`
   - Schedules WorkManager task for background Firestore sync
   - Returns immediately (non-blocking)

3. **DeliveryTrackingWorker** (runs periodically in background):
   - Reads pending status from MessageStatus table
   - Syncs to Firestore subcollections at `messages/{messageId}/status/{userId}`

### When User Reads a Message

1. (Not yet implemented - would be similar to delivery)
2. Call `messageStatusDao.markAsRead()`
3. ReadReceiptWorker syncs to Firestore

### How UI Displays Status

1. **conversationMessagesStream** provider (messaging_providers.dart:207-314):
   - Watches messages from Firestore
   - For EACH message, queries MessageStatus table: `messageStatusDao.getStatusForMessage(msg.id)`
   - Builds `MessageWithStatus` object with computed aggregate status
   - Returns Map with `status`, `readCount`, `deliveredCount` fields

2. **Status Computation Logic** (message_with_status.dart):
   - **For sent messages:** Aggregates status across all recipients (group chat support)
   - **For received messages:** Simple lookup of current user's status
   - **Returns:** 'sent', 'delivered', or 'read'

## Debugging Steps

### Step 1: Check if Local Status is Being Written

Run this SQL query in the app's Drift database to see if status records exist:

```sql
SELECT * FROM message_status WHERE messageId = '<your-message-id>';
```

**Expected result:** Should see records with status='delivered' for messages in open conversations.

**If empty:** The `markMessagesDelivered` provider is not being called or failing silently.

### Step 2: Check Debug Logs

When opening a conversation, you should see these logs:

```
[markMessagesDelivered] Marked messages in <conversationId> as delivered for <userId>
```

When watching messages, you should see:

```
ðŸ“Š Message <id>: computed status=delivered (participantIds=[...])
```

**If you see status=sent:** MessageStatus table has no records for that message.

### Step 3: Check Firestore Subcollections

In Firebase Console:
1. Navigate to `conversations/{conversationId}/messages/{messageId}`
2. Look for **subcollection** named `status`
3. Check if there are documents with userId as document ID

**If missing:** WorkManager task hasn't run yet or failed.

### Step 4: Check WorkManager Registration

Look for this log on app startup:

```
[WorkManager] Periodic tasks registered
```

And when tasks run:

```
[WorkManager] delivery-tracking complete: X synced, Y failed
```

## Common Issues

### Issue: Status always shows "sent", never "delivered"

**Possible Causes:**
1. `markMessagesDelivered` not being called when conversation opens
2. MessageStatusDao.markAllAsDelivered() failing silently
3. Messages sent by current user (sender doesn't get delivery status)
4. Participant IDs not matching (userId mismatch)

**Fix:** Check debug logs for Step 2 above. Add breakpoint in `markMessagesDelivered()`.

### Issue: Old messages have deliveredTo map field in Firestore

**Cause:** These are messages created before the refactoring.

**Fix:** No action needed. MessageModel.fromJson() ignores these fields. They don't affect the new system.

### Issue: Firestore subcollections not being created

**Possible Causes:**
1. WorkManager tasks not registered
2. Network constraint preventing background sync
3. DeliveryTrackingWorker throwing exceptions

**Fix:** Check WorkManager logs. Try running app on WiFi to satisfy network constraints.

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Send a message in a conversation
- [ ] Check Drift database for MessageStatus records (should be empty for sender's own messages)
- [ ] Open conversation as RECIPIENT
- [ ] Check debug logs for "Marked messages... as delivered"
- [ ] Check Drift database for MessageStatus records (should now have delivered status)
- [ ] Check UI - message bubble should show "delivered" indicator
- [ ] Wait 15 minutes for WorkManager periodic task
- [ ] Check Firestore for status subcollections
- [ ] Check WorkManager logs for sync confirmation

## Next Steps for User

Please run through the debugging steps above and report:
1. What you see in the debug logs when opening a conversation
2. Whether MessageStatus records are being created in Drift
3. The actual status value being computed in the "ðŸ“Š Message" debug log

This will help identify exactly where the flow is breaking.
