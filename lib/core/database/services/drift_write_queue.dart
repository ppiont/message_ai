/// Centralized write queue for all Drift database operations.
///
/// This service ensures that all database writes are serialized, preventing
/// SQLite's "database is locked" errors that occur with concurrent writes.
///
/// **Why This Exists:**
/// SQLite only supports a single writer at a time. When multiple services
/// (UserSyncService, MessageRepository, ConversationRepository, etc.) try to
/// write simultaneously, they compete for the lock and fail.
///
/// **How It Works:**
/// - All write operations are enqueued
/// - Operations are processed sequentially (FIFO)
/// - No concurrent writes = no database locks
/// - Deterministic behavior under load
///
/// **Usage:**
/// ```dart
/// final queue = ref.read(driftWriteQueueProvider);
/// await queue.enqueue(() => db.userDao.updateUser(uid, companion));
/// ```
